# Password-management

1.javac GenPass.java
2.java GenPass
3.javac VerifyPass.java
4.java VerifyPass

Note: Both programs will ask for username and password. First it will ask for user name only, 
then you enter and it will ask for password.
For example:
enter user name
bob
enter password
456

And I am storing user name and password in password.txt file. Intially file is empty, so need to generate user name and password by GenPass java class.
And check the same by running VerifyPass java class
